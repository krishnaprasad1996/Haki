AI bot capable of handling all use cases as that of a human. 

This project is to create a bot capable of developing insights by itself without the help of predefined datasets. It is supposed to learn on its own by collecting real-time data, similar to what a human child does. The idea is to raise a bot over time like a human child to achieve the level of intelligence possessed by a human, instead of creating a model that would be the reflection of the dataset we provide.
